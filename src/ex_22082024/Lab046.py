# here 'i' is a variable name it can be anything.
# (1,10,1) 1 is to start, 10 is to stop always 10-1, 1 is step one by one
for i in range(1, 10, 1):
    print(i)
for pallavi in range(1, 10, 1):
    print(pallavi,end=" ")
    #here we can use end separator so that if we want range in new line it is by default
    #but if we want in space we can use separator
